          Budapest in Hungary, one of the four capitals on Danube – the second largest European river. In 2018, on the
          10th and 11th May, again the stage for the Craft Conference, which this year celebrated its 5th birthday. The
          Craft Conference is focused on the software delivery craftsmanship, standing on three pillars:
          Language-agnostic methods and best practices (TDD, BDD, non-functional matters, etc.), Team-organisational
          topics and best practices, New trends and upcoming technologies.</p>
        <p>For me, a business analyst involved and interested in software delivery, the main motivation for attending
          the conference was: Experiencing the event itself; learning about topics directly relevant to business
          analysis (e.g. BDD), and getting new ideas from the broader field of the software delivery universe.</p>
        <h3>Testing, Faster – A workshop with Dan North</h3>
        <img src="/img/blog/ivan-dan-craft.jpg" alt="a photo with Dan North" class="blog-image-left">
        <p>Two days preceding the conference were dedicated to workshops ranging from non-technical to highly technical
          ones. In 2017 I became a practitioner of BDD, so going for the Dan North’s workshop was a no-brainer. The
          workshop promised to give a broader view on testing, yet, as Dan North is the originator of BDD, I expected to
          experience also this. The workshop took place at the premises of IBM Budapest and this turned out to a pain
          point hard to overcome even for speaker of Dan North’s level. The venue was a church-like room with terrible
          acoustics. With nearly forty participants and lots of echo, it was hardly possible not only to hear Dan but
          also anyone else, self including.

        </p>
        <p>Leaving aside the spatial challenges, the workshop started with a brainstorming on possible testing
          approaches and assigning them into the “Testing Corners” matrix. This exercise made us aware of how individual
          testing approaches need to be combined to achieve the best outcomes, i.e. working software which is
          transparent, easy to maintain, test and further develop. Hardly is there a person, who has never experienced
          that testing is often looked-down at as a burden and unavoidable cost, which hopefully will be very soon and
          completely taken-care of by robots. Dan North showed us that there is still a future for test engineers. And
          it is likely to be very bright. Automation should do what it is good at – repetitive, boring, mainly
          regression testing. By this it will free hands to human test engineers who should do what machines are bad at
          – exploratory testing, UX experience testing, seeing the broader picture and coming up with edge cases no
          robot can think of.</p>
        <p>After this, Dan facilitated a discussion on what makes a good test and a bad test. Being able to come up with
          quality tests is conditioned by accurate understanding of the functionality and underlying requirements.
          Understanding not only on the individual level, rather on the team level. At this point BDD came onto the
          stage and Dan spoken about three steps it involves: Having a conversation to understand a requirement as a
          team, Capturing the common understanding in a form of scenarios, Automating the scenarios by turning them into
          tests. Quite often teams bring a disaster upon themselves by aiming for test automation without having done
          the previous two steps. By this they end up with wrong tests, which are not only useless, but even more give
          false outcomes and are an overhead to maintain.</p>
        <p>The workshop left me with mixed feelings. The main downturn was the venue and then the number of participants
          (approx. 40) which turned the event into a lecture with audience participation. On the other hand Dan is a
          charming, knowledgeable experienced professional and as I had a chance to sit with him when we all went to for
          a lunch, we could have a chat. I asked him why he had never written a book on BDD himself. “Because by writing
          a book you pin it down,” he replied and then elaborated: “I see BDD as a living, evolving approach. Writing a
          book about it would give it a sense of something finished – which it isn’t.”</p>
        <p>This is the reason why Dan has been mainly blogging about the BDD. Yet, as much as I understand his point,
          having a structured text guiding one through an an unexplored field, is not a bad thing. Luckily, there was
          Gaspar Nagy, taking part at the workshop as well – and as I was about to learn on the last day of the
          conference, Gaspar had written such a book and was also about to give a hands-on workshop!</p>
        <h3>Conference Talks – Personal Highlights</h3>
        <h4>Five key challenges for software quality tomorrow – Gojko Adzic</h4>
        <p>A rather entertaining talk on how imperfections in design of technical solutions can bring unexpected and not
          always pleasant outcomes. A representative example is what happened at the Amazon Marketplace to the book The
          Making of a Fly: The Genetics of Animal Design. In 2011 the title was offered at the Amazon Marketplace and
          its price soon went up $23,698,655.93. The reason behind this was not that the book was that rare. Rather, it
          was caused by software which was used by other re-sellers. A re-seller with a better customer-satisfaction
          rating than the person who originally offered the book, could benefits from their higher rating and offer the
          book for a slightly higher price to make a profit. Every other re-seller with a slightly better rating than
          the other re-sellers could do the same and ask for a slightly better price. As all this was handled by a
          pricing algorithm the price of the book soon went through the roof. A funny situation, one would say – but now
          consider the same has already happened at a stock market. In his talk Gojko mentioned several other examples
          where automation led us into unpredictable ways. There is also a book <i>Humans vs. Computers</i> recently
          published
          by him to read more and even find out suggestion how not to fall in one of these traps.</p>
        <h4>The People Patch – Adventures in Social Engineering – Jenny Radcliffe</h4>
        <p>When I was reading The Art of Deception by Keving Mitnick in 2007, I for the first time came across the idea
          the humans are the weakest link the the security of any system. Jenny Radcliffe who calls herself a human
          hacker is a living example proving this statement. As a teenager Jenny loved breaking into old, unused
          buildings and getting for free into music festivals. This adventurous pursuit brought her into a career where
          she as a white hat hacker looking for weaknesses in the security of high-profile international organisations
          who have already invested millions to be secure. And she is doing so without any noticeable technical
          expertise, just by looking for publicly available information and benefiting from the human psyche. The talk
          was extremely interesting, even more so nowadays when everyone scatters private information on social networks
          without being aware how it could get misused if piled up.</p>
        <h4>Software Development is Upside down – Allan Kelly</h4>
        <p>In the economics courses at the university I was taught about economies of scale. The higher volume a factory
          can produce, the cheaper unit price it can get. Applying the same approach to software delivery is a huge
          mistake, yet so often done everywhere around us. Allan Kelly in his spectacular, easy to understand and
          entertaining way laid out why delivering software in smaller volumes is more meaningful. In other words buying
          10 packages of half-a-liter milk is more cost-efficient than getting a 10l barrel. Do you want to know more?
          Watch for yourself here.</p>
        <h4>Writing Better BDD Scenario – Gaspar Nagy & Seb Rose</h4>
        A two-hour workshop given by Gaspar Nagy and Seb Rose came as an utter surprise to me. Even though I intended to
        participate, I did not expect such a hands-on experience on a conference day dedicated to talks. Gaspar and Seb
        have co-authored a recently published Discovery: Explore Behaviour Using Examples focused on the discovery part
        of the BDD approach. Right now they are working on two more titles (Formulation, Automation) to cover the topic
        fully. They conveyed the workshop in a way which allowed the participants to understand the value of
        collaborative requirement discovery as well as formulation of requirements into Given-When-Then scenarios. Only
        when reading the concisely written book at home, I realized the whole workshop was based on it. Combination of
        the workshop experience and the printed guide will surely allow me to put the BDD approach even further into
        everyday life of our project team.
        <br>
        <p>Craft conference was a positive experience for me. Not only because there was a plethora of interesting talks
          but also because the event was a great opportunity to meet colleagues from the field, discover new ideas and
          surprisingly also to learn more about the colleagues from our own team who came along.</p>
