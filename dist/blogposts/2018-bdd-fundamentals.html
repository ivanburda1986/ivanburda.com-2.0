        <p>
          Henry Ford has coined hundreds of brilliant ideas, yet, there is one
          which is very much true even in the today’s world of software
          delivery:
          <i>“Coming together is a beginning. Keeping together is progress.
            Working together is success.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          In the spring 2017, when I first heard about Behaviour-Driven
          Development (BDD) and read the book BDD In Action, I understood BDD
          as a way to better specify requirements at our software-delivery
          project. After all, back then this was a goal of a business analyst
          – to write better specification and throw it over the fence to a
          developer and tester so that they would know what to do. BDD in the
          way I got it seemed to be a sound remedy to the issues we faced back
          in the days, mainly improvements coming out of the clash between
          business expectations vs. our delivery, and lots of bugs stemming
          from the fact that we neither had a common way to write our
          specifications, nor did we practice an approach that would allow us
          to understand requirements at the team level. You can read more
          about those times in the introduction to another post of mine:
          <a href="/blogposts/2018-spec-by-example.html">Specification by Example with Gojko Adzic</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The participation at the workshop given by Gojko in early 2018
          opened my eyes a bit more and I started to see the real idea behind
          BDD. To be fair towards the BDD in Action, re-reading the book
          allowed me to see what I originally did not get. BDD is not about
          writing better specification, even though it eventually helps to do
          that. BDD is rather about delivering maintainable software of a
          great value through better cooperation and communication within a
          team.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Johan Wolfgang von Goethe once put it:
          <i>“Everyone hears only what he understands.” </i> This was true for
          my original understanding of BDD and this has turned out to be true
          also for our software-delivery project. Individual people at various
          roles at our project quite often understood expectations,
          requirements and specifications in their own ways – and they were
          not even aware of the different understanding until it came to light
          at a very late stage, usually after the development had finished.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I met Gáspár Nagy and Seb Rose at the
          <a href="/blogposts/2018-craft-budapest.html">Craft Conerence in May 2018</a>
          they outlined to me how to make everyone
          <b>u-n-d-e-r-s-t-a-n-d</b> in the same way. They called this
          approach a deliberate discovery, i.e. a discovery of the
          requirements intentionally before lots of effort get invested,
          rather than accidentally in a form of unpleasant surprises during
          the development or even at the deployment stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reading their
          <a href="http://bddbooks.com/" target="_blank">concise book on the topic</a>
          showed me that the deliberate discovery was just the first step
          towards applying BDD at a project, yet a quintessential one for
          being able to put into practice the following two steps: Formulation
          and Automation. First the team needs to agree and understand what it
          is to be done, only then the functionality can be specified
          (formulation), and only then automated tests may be created and
          living documentation achieved (automation). It would be easy to go
          for automation immediately, yet automating something we are not sure
          of is a certain way to a disaster. At the same time as the authors
          put it
          <i>“Delivery is mandatory. The subsequent practices [formulation,
            automation] deliver incremental value and facilitate continuous
            delivery and continuous deployment.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Seb and Gaspar’s book on the deliberate discovery was an easy
          weekend read. Even before turning the last page it was clear to me
          this was the way to work in our team. Luckily enough, adopting the
          approach seemed easier, as we had just transitioned our organisation
          towards a cross-functional setup with full-stack highly independent
          verticals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within our team (a squad) we made a decision to put the ideas from
          the deliberate-discovery book into action. This meant we met as a
          team to discuss one of the upcoming functionalities. At that moment
          all roles (a product owner, a business analyst, a developer, a
          tester, a designer) found themselves in a room and with the
          facilitation of our scrum master we spoke about one of the next
          things to deliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          People started coming up with ideas, questions, we pointed out weak
          points of the requirement. Even at the very first attempt to do
          deliberate discovery it was obvious that engagement and the
          different-role-perspective benefit was something we had ignored a
          way to much. Yet, we struggled with the example mapping and
          excessive freedom – it seemed like we could discuss the
          functionality for hours and days, easily missing an expected
          delivery date. This struggling seemed to be a great preparation for
          a workshop I had anyway intended to organize – so we asked Seb and
          Gáspár to come and share their knowledge and years of experience
          with us directly.
        </p>
        The two give their <i>BDD Fundamentals</i> workshop in two days and
        cover all three parts. Yet, I deliberately asked whether it would be
        possible to make two customizations:
        <ul class="dotted-list">
          <li>
            Have a single-day workshop focused on understanding the value of
            deliberate discovery (the mandatory part of BDD) as a team, dig a
            bit into the formulation, yet leave the more technical part
            (automation) possibly for another time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Teach us the deliberate discovery using an upcoming functionality
            from our project rather than using a general example such as an
            address change for a pizza delivery business.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When the day of the workshop came on the 31st of July 2018, the
          fifteen of us and the trainers met to spend a day together. Most of
          our team members managed to take part and the remaining spaces were
          offered to scrum masters and product owners of other teams, so that
          they would be able to evaluate a possible benefit of such a workshop
          to their work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trainers started with a set of true/false statements which were
          meant to see what our understanding of BDD was before the workshop,
          so that we would be able to compare it to the understanding at the
          end of the day. After that, Seb and Gáspár let us brainstorm about
          the meaning of terms such as deliberate discovery,
          rules-examples-tests, and living documentation. Once done, we
          together went through the terms in the context of the Behaviour
          Driven Development, where the trainers used their 50 years of shared
          experience with software delivery to demonstrate why projects fail
          and how the chances for sucess can be tremendously increased by
          applying the BDD principles. This served as a great support for the
          BDD evangelization I had done internally because the two BDD
          practicioners could answer all questions and back up the answers by
          experience from numerous projects.

            on individual green cards
          </li>
          <li>
            questions that cannot be answered get parked on red cards to be
            answered after the session
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b><u>Output</u></b>
        </p>
        <ul class="dotted-list">
          <li>a yellow card with the name of the discussed story</li>
          <li>
            a set of blue cards with rules related to the discussed
            functionality
          </li>
          <li>
            a set of green cards with various example demonstrating the rules
            (at least 2 examples for each rule)
          </li>
          <li>
            a set of red cards with questions that need to get answered and
            further discussed
          </li>
          <li>NOT a set of Given-When-Then scenarios</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As a team we managed to see how the example-mapping based deliberate
          discovery session should be done while applying it on a a real
          functionality from our project which we are about to deliver in the
          upcoming months. Even though deliberate discovery sessions may be
          seen as a huge time investment, they have proven to bring worthy
          benefits. They increase team engagement, support knowledge sharing,
          and bring better understanding of functionalities to be build.
          Having the same understanding across the organization before the
          development starts eventually reduces the number of must-have
          improvements and bugs. This is a valuable return on investment which
          speeds up the delivery, boosts the quality, builds trust, and
          increases the satisfaction of the team: the team can focus most of
          their energy on a meaningful evolution of the product rather than on
          never-ending firefighting of what has (again) gone wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          The example mapping as a discovery technique invented by Matt Wynne
          and used within BDD is fully documented online in
          <a href="https://cucumber.io/blog/bdd/example-mapping-introduction/" target="_blank">a Cucumber blogpost
            written by Matt himself</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only once a deliberate discovery of a specific story is finished,
          the shared understanding can get transferred from the color-based
          cards (a story, rules, examples) into the Given-When-Then scenarios
          using the Gherkin syntax. These scenarios can subsequently be used
          on top of the implementation and automated tests to create a living
          documentation. Such a documentation provides at any time an
          up-to-date overview of the desired behaviour with the actual state
          (pass/fail/to-do) for each of the scenarios – and most importantly
          this documentation can be read and understood by all stakeholders
          regardles the level of their technical background.
        </p>

        <h4>This is how BDD looks from 5,000 feet:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Decide the next user story to work on</li>
          <li>
            Use concrete examples to explore and discover the acceptance
            criteria for the user story
          </li>
          <li>Formulate a concrete example as a scenario</li>
          <li>Automate a scenario and see it fail</li>
          <li>Write a programmer test and see it fail</li>
          <li>Write enough code to make the programmer test pass</li>
          <li>Refactor to clean up the code</li>
          <li>Manual exploratory testing</li>
          <li>Release to production</li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b><u>The BDD Fundamentals Workshop by Gáspár Nagy and Seb Rose was
              extremely well executed and the participants appreciated
              especially:</u></b>
        </p>
        <ul class="dotted-list">
          <li>the chance to meet experts from the agile universe</li>
          <li>
            getting better understanding of BDD and the benefits it brings
          </li>
          <li>
            getting experience with the deliberate discovery using the example
            mapping technique

            attending as a squad brought an unexpected team-building benefit
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          At the same time the participants would like to have spent more time
          with the trainers to get additional experience with the example
          mapping technique. Developers and testers also wish to have had the
          automation as a part of the workshop to learn the technicalities
          behind BDD. Yet the automation part was deliberately left out in
          order to reduce the scope and complexity of the workshop, and can
          get organized as a standalone session later on.
        </p>
        <p>
          The BDD Fundaments workshop has clarified to our team how to do the
          deliberate discovery and example mapping properly and more
          efficiently. It has also inspired us to go deeper into the
          automation and living documentation direction. We have already
          turned this inspiration into a working proof of concept where we
          integrated the cypress.io all-in-one testing framework, which is
          used at our project, with a cucumber plugin and reached
          gherkin-based living documentation for a part of our functionality
          where we have had a great cross-team understanding. I do recommend
          the BDD workshop with Gáspar and Seb to any team that wants to learn
          doing the discovery part of Behaviour Driven Development and to any
          team which wants to collaborate in a better way – because as Henry
          Ford put it, working together is success.
