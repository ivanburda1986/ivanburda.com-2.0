        <h4>For more than two years I have been working on a project where the goals of our team are:</h4>
        <ul class="dotted-list">
          <li>Designing an API layer to open a group of financial organizations to the world</li>
          <li>Creating an innovative, easy-to-use online solution that will help customers to improve their financial
            lives</li>
          <li>Setting up a platform for 3rd-party plugins</li>
        </ul>
        When I joined I was a junior business analyst (BA) and what is clear to me now when looking over my shoulder
        into the past, was not clear to me back then. It is not only me, the whole team has made a huge progress.
        <h4>At my project beginnings, the team worked like this:</h4>
        <ul class="dotted-list">
          <li>Product owner outlined a requirement</li>
          <li>Business analyst wrote a set of stories elaborating this requirement (usually in a form of unstructured
            narrative)</li>
          <li>Developers took the stories and tried to implement them</li>
          <li>Testers had a look at the development output, tried to test it manually, using rather a gut feeling than a
            having a clear set of acceptance criteria</li>
          <li>The FE functionality got deployed to a UAT</li>
          <li>Feedback arrived: lots of bugs, a clash of the reality and the expectations</li>
        </ul>
        Since this time we have made a huge progress. Besides other things, our specifications have become more
        structured and a they even contain behaviour-driven-development (BDD) based scenarios.
        <h4>The scenarios have helped a lot to everyone involved:</h4>
        <ul class="dotted-list">
          <li>BA has to think about the expected requirement behaviour in a more complete way</li>
          <li>Product owner (PO) can check the scenarios and have a handshake with the BA before the development starts
          </li>
          <li>Developers have an idea of what is expected from them, where to start, where to finish and how to know
            they have done what is expected</li>
          <li>Developers use the BDD (Given-when-then) scenarios for writing unit tests</li>
          <li>Testers have at least a rough idea what they should (manually) test</li>
          <li>Anyone who opens a requirement specification can get an overview quickly</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>A huge improvement since the times of the stream-of-consciousness kind of specification. Yet we still face
          these issues:</h4>
        <ul class="dotted-list">
          <li>Our documentation for the frontend (FE) code is manually written (therefore incomplete, outdated)</li>
          <li>The test coverage of the FE code is insufficient and not reliable</li>
          <li>The manually written documentation is not in any automatic/interactive relationship with the FE code</li>
          <li>Team members lack knowledge about the FE solution</li>
          <li> Lots of misunderstanding during the development as well as bugs during the acceptance stage</li>
        </ul>
        When re-reading the book <i>BDD in Action</i> which has worked for me and the team really well as a learning
        source to
        enhance our specifications with scenarios, and when watching related talks by Dan North, I realized an important
        fact: The job of a business analyst is not to come up with a solution on his/her own and put this solution into
        scenarios. The key responsibility of a BA is to get the team (PO, BA, developer, tester, designer) together to
        have a conversation and find out the most suitable solution by discovering questions that have not been
        considered/asked before. Looking for more information I found an interview with Gojko Adzic – who as a matter of
        coincidence(?) planned to come to the city where I live and give a two-day workshop on the topic: Specification
        by Example.
        <h4>There were seven of us and instead of long introductions, Gojko suggested an activity for which he:</h4>
        <ul class="dotted-list">
          <li>Asked us to split into two groups</li>
          <li>Gave us a list of of Black-Jack card game rules</li>
          <li>Told us he represents a non-technical business owner to answer our questions</li>
          <li>Asked us to come up with a paper-based implementation of the game. We could create a set of scenarios,
            draw a diagram, draw pictures or anything we wanted. Afterwards one of us would be a machine that will be
            tested by the client, and this machine would have to operate strictly by following our paper-based
            implementation</li>
          <li>He time-boxed the activity for 15 minutes</li>
        </ul>
        The rules of the game given to us were written on a single A4 page and as we found ourselves under a time
        pressure we started with the “implementation” immediately. After the 15 minutes one team had a process diagram,
        the other team had a set of Given-when-then scenarios. As we were not ready yet, Gojko agreed to move our
        project deadline by another 5 minutes.
        <h4>After the additional 5 minutes Gojko:</h4>
        <ul class="dotted-list">
          <li>Gave us a set of acceptance tests</li>
          <li>Asked one of us to be a tester, one of us to be the Black-Jack casino machine, one of us to be an observer
            which makes sure the machine follows strictly the paper-based implementation we have done</li>
          <li>Time-boxed the activity for 10 minutes</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Result:</b> The implementations of the both teams failed all acceptance tests provided. A big spoonful of
        harsh truth.
        <h4>Lessons learned:</h4>
        <ul class="dotted-list">
          <li><b>We started working immediately before thinking more about the requirements -></b> Before you start
            working,
            even if there is time pressure, take 10% of the time to question the
            requirements.</li>
          <li><b>We did not ask for the acceptance criteria -> </b>Ask the business who is going to accept the solution
            and what the acceptance criteria are. What should fail/pass?</li>
          <li><b>We took the business requirements as correct and given -> </b>Don’t fall into the trap that business
            stakeholders know what they want. Usually they don’t and it is not their mistake.
            The role of a BA is to find out and clarify the real and relevant requirements of the business. This should
            be done by triggerring a conversation to discover questions nobody had asked before.</li>
          <li><b>We felt like there was not enough time -> </b>Don’t say there is not enough time to do something – say
            instead that within the given time you can deliver only a limited scope.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After we finished this 20+10 minutes long activity, and tested our implementation with the acceptance
          criteria (examples of expected behaviour), we started to find out questions and unclarities. It also turned
          out that not even all members of our team understood the original requirements in the same way. Unfortunately,
          the unclarities became visible only after the implementation – sadly, this is what usually happens in everyday
          life.</p>
        <p>Important to say that the acceptance criteria given to us by business turned out to be wrong, even
          contradictory. But this did not matter – they helped us to have a conversation and discover problems.</p>
        <p>As Gojko pointed out afterwards, the real problems stem from things which are clear – because they are
          “clear” to different people in different ways. Things which are unclear, on the other hand, are good, because
          they instantly make us aware there are still questions to be answered.</p>
        <p>This activity taught us that if a team discusses examples of expected behaviour during the specification
          process then the team can even in very short time find out lots of unclear spots. All this before the real
          implementation starts.</p>
        <p>An important input for such a specification-by-example session are some acceptance criteria – if not prepared
          by business, then by the BA based on the goals of the business.</p>
        <p>As Gojko mentioned, feedback often comes after the implementation (too late) when people get something they
          can complain about. So instead of asking business for final requirements, the business should be given
          something to complain about in advance, before the development starts.</p>
        <p>The “something” to complain about can be a list of acceptance tests (Given-when-then scenarios) based on what
          the team learnt during the specification-by-examples session. Alternatively it can be a table, a picture, a
          behaviour model. Suitability depends on the character of the requirements.</p>
        <p>Having done the specification-by-example session the BA will afterwards find out answers to the newly-emerged
          questions and will provide business stakeholders with the scenarios/acceptance tests/etc. At this point the
          business stakeholders will be able to give feedback (complain).</p>
        <p>Only after the questions get answered and and feedback gets provided by the business, a more mature
          requirements can be written down. This is the point where the BA should specify the solution based on the new
          findings. A set of given-when-then scenarios, a picture, diagram, a table with examples – all will work well
          depending on the context.</p>
        <p>Specification-by-example discussions can literally save weeks of development, because it reduces
          misunderstanding, bugs, necessity for improvements as well as any clashes between what gets delivered and what
          was expected. In addition to this, specification by example makes the whole team involved and supports
          knowledge sharing.</p>



        <h4>Facing resistance:</h4>
        <ul class="dotted-list">
          <li><b>The team thinks they do not have time for such a new approach. Developers are busy typing the code,
              testers clicking around etc. -> </b>Do not offer a tool by saying that you are going to do specification
            by example. Point out the reasons why everyone is busy because of trying to understand requirements and
            because of fixing everything that has gone wrong. Then suggest an experiment where a whole team participates
            in discussing the requirements. Time-box the experiment to 30 minutes. Say that if that does not work, the
            team loses 30 minutes once a week. If it works, everyone benefits from it and fewer bugs and better solution
            will make everyone less busy/stressed/overloaded in the end.</li>
          <li><b>The business owners say they do not have time to have a meeting with you to discuss question and some
              additional examples: -> </b>Ask the business owners how important the project is to them. They will most
            likely say that very important. Then tell them that if the project is very important, why they think it is
            not worth spending a few more moments to better understand and nail down the requirements. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Where to go from here?</h4>
        <ul class="dotted-list">
          <li>The most important benefit of specification by example is to have better understanding of the product to
            be developed, where this understanding has been reached through a discussion involving all team members.
          </li>
          <li>Once this is done, the given-when-then scenarios specifying the solution can be used as an input for
            automated testing. Tools for turning the scenarios into automated tests are for example Cucumber or FitNess.
          </li>
          <li>It is vital to make a decision what needs to be tested automatically and what manually. Automation on its
            own does not solve anything. </li>
          <li>Automation be applied to things which are correct, otherwise we will only get into troubles faster.</li>
          <li>Automated tests should be version-controlled to get easily matched with the version we want to test.</li>
          <li>Cucumber scenarios can be further (automatically) exported into HTML, PDF or Confluence (using Green
            Pepper plugin), so that they become more accessible to wider audience.</li>
          <li>As Gojko points out, people often think there is no documentation in the agile delivery approach. This is
            not true. There is documentation, but it is more bound to the code. By this it is always up to date. In the
            agile approach the acceptance tests (criteria) equal the specification and equal the documentation. To quote
            the author: “Living documentation is a reliable and authoritative source of information on system
            functionality, which anyone can easily access.”</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>The last word</h4>
        <p>The workshop with Gojko Adzic literally exceeded all my expectation. Similarly to business owners, before the
          workshop I was not even fully aware what to ask for and what should be delivered.
          Gojko is highly professional and enthusiastic in his approached. Rather then just sharing theories he manages
          to teach by experience. During the two-day workshop I experienced how things usually go wrong and managed to
          find out and learn how to work better. Highly recommended.</p>
